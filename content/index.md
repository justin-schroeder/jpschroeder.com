## 👋 Hi there,

I’m Justin, a full-stack developer based in [Charlottesville, VA](https://www.visitcharlottesville.org/), and working at [FormKit](https://formkit.com). I’ve been writing code for ~<year-count></year-count>. I have plenty of opinions about web development, and I often share those on [𝕏 (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=jpschroeder).

When I’m not spending time with my wife and three little boys, you’ll find me creating and maintaining open&nbsp;source. I always keep my [DMs open](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=12008842) — so feel free to contact me&nbsp;there.

## Open source

Creating open source projects is one of my passions. Here are some that I’ve&nbsp;made.
