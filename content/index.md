## 👋 Hi there,

I’m Justin, a full-stack developer based in [Charlottesville, VA](https://www.visitcharlottesville.org/), and working at [FormKit](https://formkit.com). I’ve been writing code for ~<year-count></year-count>. I have plenty of opinions about web development, and I often share those on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=jpschroeder).

When I’m not spending time with my wife and three little boys, you’ll find me creating and maintaining open&nbsp;source. I always keep my [DMs open](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=12008842) — so feel free to contact me&nbsp;there.

## Open source

Creating open source projects is one of my passions. Here are some that I’ve&nbsp;created.

## Articles

I generally post long form thoughts, opinions, and announcements as articles on [dev.to](https://dev.to/dashboard). Here are a&nbsp;few.

## Speaking

I try to keep a running list of previous talks, meetups, and podcasts appearances&nbsp;here.
